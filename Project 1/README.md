# Project 1 â€” Market Data Collector & EDA Toolkit

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is the first in my **Quantitative Finance Projects** series.  
It focuses on **collecting, cleaning, and exploring market data** as the foundation for trading strategy research.

The goal is to:
- Download historical price data for a set of tickers
- Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize important metrics such as returns, volatility, and drawdowns

All work is documented in **Jupyter Notebooks** to clearly show methodology, results, and annotations.
